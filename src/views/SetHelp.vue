    <p>A SET is three cards where each feature, when looked at individually, is either all the <b>same</b> OR
      all <b>different</b>. Each card contains four features: color (red, purple or green), shape (oval,
      squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or outlined).</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <set-card shape="n" color="r" pattern="s" :amount="1"/>
      <set-card shape="p" color="r" pattern="s" :amount="1"/>
      <set-card shape="d" color="r" pattern="s" :amount="1"/>
    </div>
    <p>This is a set because color, pattern, and amount are <b>all same</b> and shapes are <b>all different</b>.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <set-card shape="p" color="p" pattern="s" :amount="1"/>
      <set-card shape="p" color="p" pattern="h" :amount="2"/>
      <set-card shape="p" color="p" pattern="z" :amount="3"/>
    </div>
    <p>This is a set because color and shape are <b>all same</b> and patern and amount are <b>all different</b>.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <set-card shape="n" color="r" pattern="h" :amount="1"/>
      <set-card shape="d" color="g" pattern="s" :amount="2"/>
      <set-card shape="p" color="p" pattern="z" :amount="3"/>
    </div>
    <p>This is a set because shape, color, pattern, and amount are <b>all different</b>.</p>
